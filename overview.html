  <p>The goal of MARC4J is to provide an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) 
  for working with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/">MARC XML</a> in Java. MARC stands for 
  MAchine Readable Cataloguing and is a widely used exchange format for bibliographic data. 
  MARC XML provides a loss-less conversion between MARC (MARC21 but also other formats like UNIMARC) and XML.</p>
  
  <p>The structure of a MARC record is defined in the ISO 2709:1996 (Format for Information Exchange) standard 
  (or ANSI/NISO Z39.2-1994, available <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-2.pdf">online</a> 
  from NISO). The MARC4J API is not a full implementation of the ISO 2709:1996 standard. The standard is 
  implemented as it is used in the MARC formats.</p>
 
  <p>MARC4J provides readers and writers for MARC and MARC XML. A {@link org.marc4j.MarcReader} 
  implementation parses input data and provides an iterator over a collection 
  of {@link org.marc4j.marc.Record} objects. The record object model is also suitable for in-memory 
  editing of MARC records, just as DOM is used for XML editing purposes. 
  Using a {@link org.marc4j.MarcWriter} implementation it is possible to create MARC or MARC XML. 
  Once MARC data has been converted to XML you can further process the result with XSLT, for 
  example to convert MARC to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a>.</p>

  <p>Although MARC4J is primarily designed for Java development you can use the command-line 
    utilities {@link org.marc4j.util.MarcXmlDriver} and {@link org.marc4j.util.XmlMarcDriver} 
    to convert between MARC and MARCXML. It is also possible to pre or post process the result 
    using XSLT, for example to convert directly from MODS to MARC or from MARC to MODS.</p>
