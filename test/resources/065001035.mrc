Statistics are drawn from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which collects information from enterprises with 10 or more employees on innovation drivers and the behavior of enterprises in relation to innovation. An innovation is a new or significantly improved product (good or service) introduced to the market or the introduction within an enterprise of a new or significantly improved process. The turnover indicator is defined as the ratio of turnover from products new to the enterprise and new to the market as a % of total turnover. Provides harmonized, national-level data on the euro area, European Union (EU) member states, EU candidate states, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, where available. Indicators are presented in seven broad categories: economy and finance; population and social conditions; industry, trade, and services; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; international trade; transportation; environment and energy; and science and technology. The euro area comprises the EU member states that adopted the euro as their common currency, which was established in January 1999 with 11 countries and has expanded to 17 countries known as the EA-17: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU (EU-27) includes the EA-17 countries plus: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. EFTA currently comprises Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. For further information on the countries included in the statistics presented in this dataset, please visit http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Main_Page . Data are provided by national statistical authorities to Eurostat, where they are harmonized using European-wide methodologies. Data are released at the indicator level on a schedule maintained by Eurostat; hence, currency may vary across indicators.

Provides harmonized, national-level data on the euro area, European Union (EU) member states, EU candidate states, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, where available. Indicators are presented in seven broad categories: economy and finance; population and social conditions; industry, trade, and services; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; international trade; transportation; environment and energy; and science and technology. The euro area comprises the EU member states that adopted the euro as their common currency, which was established in January 1999 with 11 countries and has expanded to 17 countries known as the EA-17: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU (EU-27) includes the EA-17 countries plus: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. EFTA currently comprises Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.

Indicators are presented in seven broad categories: economy and finance; population and social conditions; industry, trade, and services; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; international trade; transportation; environment and energy; and science and technology. The euro area comprises the EU member states that adopted the euro as their common currency, which was established in January 1999 with 11 countries and has expanded to 17 countries known as the EA-17: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU (EU-27) includes the EA-17 countries plus: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. EFTA currently comprises Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. For further information on the countries included in the statistics presented in this dataset, please visit http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Main_Page . Data are provided by national statistical authorities to Eurostat, where they are harmonized using European-wide methodologies. Data are released at the indicator level on a schedule maintained by Eurostat; hence, currency may vary across indicators. Periodicity is annual for all indicators; monthly and quarterly data is also provided where available. 4aEuropean Union 4aResearch and Development 4aScience & Technology 4aTechnological Development 4aNorway40uhttps://statisticaldatasets.data-planet.com/dataplanet/content?type=dp&param=7fuKsUAw6JKwfltCdIrd118FxHcMABTyBL2BWgaZZMQ_igWit6LliQmraW69jel-eOhcZIcv7Eq4UMQ5WqLmNKtWko6C48ETwX5mk_4Rr8do0I52VeE6Jyt8SvYum8sCBW36d2ffS7E2QyugIiXrRAF3NbkPic57Q8cMdeZR0QyCm6JQo_PteiNNDd4HC5DrVKRO9HLr0YAATDRXdPuRtdJgoTXUXoVdj4OL43Daev0hhPCIy-ycXVMxz2d2ZJQKpBeJBveujUyXlM-L8QTeo2WgyOY1HkGQbfyRIucIeco5VIUPJCm3mKch5Ft2NqD1t32HK_vWWo6sUzoB7ZPmGUZjPO3bvtbIs-orC4jPIjDf_gcXSs6J5Ens9lmDGexHqr7p7UxLkMdzPiR_cMuEZw%3D%3D&view=RANKING%7COrg84%7C%7CTimeUnit0%7COrg84LIST%40NO%7C281_281_0%40innINN_COAB%2C281_281_1%40indic_in%3ACOEUE_YES%21%21bar%21%21nace_r1%3AI%21%21bar%21%21sizeclas%3A10-49%21%21bar%21%21type_inn%3APANDP%21%21bar%21%21unit%3ANR%7C2000%7C%7Cfalse&exp=7fuKsUAw6JKvEAT2Orb_xsiTfTW5o29HbEM8bZqAE3XsE9XAhdG2Eo9h5Qt8fhF8Yn1GjBfzI3sfmlWJ36t4u5PMwppsaSiTDP0fUpujM9KV2lxQfofQCw%3D%3DxBASIC04409nmd a2200277 ua450000100130000000300080001300500170002100700150003800800410005304000260009411000130012024504460013325600680057926000560064733600380070333700260074133800360076751600630080352022770086665000190314365000290316265000250319165000300321665100110324685608740325739-065001035MdBeDPC20180202152612.0cr#mn#|||m||||180202c####9999mduq|#|###|||#0####1eng#|  aMdBeDPC$beng$cMdBeDPC10aEurostat10aCommunity Innovation Survey from the Eurostat Statistics databasebDate Type: Year; Country: Norway; Eurostat Table: Innovation co-operation during 1998-2000 in absolute value; Eurostat Variable: Cooperation with US suppliers of equipment etc. : Industry (except construction) : 250 employees or more : Novel innovators, product and/or process : NumbercData-Planet by Conquest SystemshData-Planet Statistical Datasets [electronic resource]  aonline resource with data filesbstatistical data and abstract.  aBethesda, MDbData-Planet by Conquest Systemsc2018  acomputer datasetbcod2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aStatistical data with bibliographic citation and abstract.  aPresents indicators of community innovation in science and technology in European Union member states and other nations on an ad hoc basis.
