Statistics are drawn from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which collects information from enterprises with 10 or more employees on innovation drivers and the behavior of enterprises in relation to innovation. An innovation is a new or significantly improved product (good or service) introduced to the market or the introduction within an enterprise of a new or significantly improved process. The turnoverÂ indicator is defined as the ratio of turnover from products new to the enterprise and new to the market as a % of total turnover. Provides harmonized, national-level data on the euro area, European Union (EU) member states, EU candidate states, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, where available. Indicators are presented in seven broad categories: economy and finance; population and social conditions; industry, trade, and services; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; international trade; transportation; environment and energy; and science and technology. The euro area comprises the EU member states that adopted the euro as their common currency, which was established in January 1999 with 11 countries and has expanded to 17 countries known as the EA-17: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU (EU-27) includes the EA-17 countries plus: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. EFTA currently comprises Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. For further information on the countries included in the statistics presented in this dataset, please visit http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Main_Page . Data are provided by national statistical authorities to Eurostat, where they are harmonized using European-wide methodologies. Data are released at the indicator level on a schedule maintained by Eurostat; hence, currency may vary across indicators. Periodicity is annual for all indicators; monthly and quarterly data is also provided where available. 4aEuropean Union 4aResearch and Development 4aScience & Technology 4aTechnological Development 4aNorway40uhttps://statisticaldatasets.data-planet.com/dataplanet/content?type=dp&param=7fuKsUAw6JJxV8xFdcm8fPnQMSMAUOSTT0htHM5z9mhpZ6Bwv7jIFAacO7WMFBFtvJ2HLubjH9q6h1gxoo14Jz__-8DqJX8GNPPM0_56gYWClfTBeZAksw01Q2qiCkDgwrR_SKPID8rQIwTP8dHBVq_F9RXWuBhZzumh8s9INHEulUqTsJfE112VsBA8WgwiEOxkBJV5FJTcZp3QXQ5kryh4-JCBzaZAedRi5NspL-mla9_mZ47BoYY0p5jq6Eua1KdlGGS9kNjNHmvZKutuVZgvTkoaELO2RKRnkqz92q_gHw_wrbbHBIUNK_CDMcecC5KMKUvFQdFPPGWqQ58FUzGFndttDm1TN9878oyq0W5GrPEKWtZRECuzPDvGCzbY_Ni2qhmVbjcPLExeH03_TQ%3D%3D&view=RANKING%7COrg84%7C%7CTimeUnit0%7COrg84LIST%40NO%7C281_281_0%40innINN_COPC%2C281_281_1%40indic_in%3ACO76_NO%21%21bar%21%21nace_r1%3AC%21%21bar%21%21sizeclas%3ATOTAL%21%21bar%21%21type_inn%3APAOP%21%21bar%21%21unit%3ART%7C2000%7C%7Cfalse&exp=7fuKsUAw6JKvEAT2Orb_xsiTfTW5o29HbEM8bZqAE3XsE9XAhdG2Eo9h5Qt8fhF8Yn1GjBfzI3sfmlWJ36t4u5PMwppsaSiTsfHqGnrRopKhywe0xQvgYQ%3D%3DxBASIC
