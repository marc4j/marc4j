 * in a sub-class to actually implement the Unicode to MARC8 character conversion.

 * large XML file at runtime, and ReverseCodeTableGenerated which consists of a couple of
 * switch statements that implement the same two methods. The code for the second of these
 * two sub-classes, ReverseCodeTableGenerated, is generated when the marc4j jar file is
 * created using the same XML file that ReverseCodeTableHash uses.
