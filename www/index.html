    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>The goal of MARC4J is to provide an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) for working with MARC records in Java.</p>
    <p>MARC stands for MAchine Readable Cataloguing and is a widely used exchange format for bibliographic data.</p>
    <p>MARC4J can be considered a parser with SAX and DOM like interfaces for MARC.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The MARC4J project started as James (Java MARC events), but since there is already an open source project called James, the project is renamed to MARC4J to avoid confusion in open source communities.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>The MARC4J library includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an easy to use event-based interface that can handle large record sets (inspired by SAX);</li>
      <li>a MARC record object model (like DOM for XML) including the possibility to marshal record objects to tape format (ISO 2709);</li>
      <li>support for conversions from ANSEL to UCS/Unicode and back;</li>
      <li>vendor neutral XML support through JAXP and SAX2, a high performance XML interface;</li>
      <li>support for conversions between MARC and MARCXML, the MARC XML exchange format recently published by the Library of Congress;</li>
      <li>a build-in pipeline model to preprocess or postprocess MARCXML using any XSLT processor that supports the JAXP interface;</li>
      <li>validation against W3C XML Schema's using a JAXP 1.2 compliant parser;</li>
      <li>tightly integrated with the JAXP and SAX2 interfaces;</li>
      <li>easy to integrate with other XML interfaces like DOM, JDOM or DOM4J;</li>
      <li>Javadoc documentation;</li>
      <li>a basic tutorial covering most features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using MARC4J it is easy to write any kind of Java application or servlet that involves MARC or MARCXML data. MARC4J provides SAX2 consumers and producers for conversions between MARC and MARCXML, including support for character conversions between MARC-8 and UCS/Unicode environments. Together with the SAX2 interface it is possible to write robust MARC to XML conversion programs simply by implementing the methods in the <code>MarcHandler</code> interface. The MARC record object model can be used to convert XML back to MARC tape format. The record object model is also suitable for in-memory editing of MARC records, just as DOM is used for XML editing purposes. The MARC4J library can also be used for reporting purposes, to import MARC records into databases, or to provide transformations between different MARC formats.</p>
    <h3>Download</h3>
    <p>The first release under the name MARC4J is planned for mid-July.</p>

    <h3>About MARC</h3>
    <p>MARC stands for MAchine-Readable Cataloguing. The MARC format is a popular exchange format for bibliographic records. The structure of a MARC record is defined in the ISO 2709:1996 (Format for Information Exchange) standard (or ANSI/NISO Z39.2-1994, available <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-2.pdf">online</a> from NISO). The MARC4J API is not a full implementation of the ISO 2709:1996 standard. The standard is implemented as it is used in the MARC formats.</p>
    <p>The most popular MARC formats are MARC21 and UNIMARC. The MARC21 format is maintained by the <a href="http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>. If you're not familiar with MARC21, you might want to read <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/umb/">Understanding MARC Bibliographic</a>, "a brief description and tutorial" on the standard. For more information on the MARC21 format, visit the <A href="http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/marc">MARC formats</a> home page at the Library of Congress Web site. For more information about UNIMARC visit <a href="http://www.ifla.org/VI/3/ubcim.htm">UBCIM</a> (IFLA Universal Bibliographic Control and International MARC Core Programme).</p>
