    <title>MARC4J</title>

  <body>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p> The goal of MARC4J is to provide an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) for working with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/">MARC XML</a> in Java. MARC stands for MAchine Readable Cataloguing and is a widely used exchange format for bibliographic data. MARC XML provides a loss-less conversion between MARC (MARC21 but also other formats like UNIMARC) and XML.</p>
    <p>Starting from release 2.0rc1 MARC4J is completely rebuild. 2.0 releases are not compatible with older versions of MARC4J. That is why, although there has never been a 1.0 release, new releases continue with 2.0. The event based parser is replaced by an easier to use interface that uses a simple iterator over a collection of MARC records. The following code sample shows the basic use of the parser:</p>
    <pre>
   InputStream input = new FileInputStream("file.mrc");
   MarcReader reader = new MarcStreamReader(input);
   while (reader.hasNext()) {
     Record record = reader.next();
     // Process record object
   }</pre>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>MARC4J releases beta 6 through beta 8a where based on an event based parser like SAX for XML.</p>
    <p>The MARC4J project started as James (Java MARC events), but since there is already an open source project called James, the project is renamed to MARC4J to avoid confusion in open source communities.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>The MARC4J library includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An easy to use interface that can handle large record sets;</li>
      <li>Readers and writers for both MARC and MARC XML;</li>
      <li>A build-in pipeline model to pre- or postprocess MARC XML using any XSLT processor that supports the JAXP interface;</li>
      <li>A MARC record object model (like DOM for XML) for in-memory editing of MARC records;</li>
      <li>Support for data conversions from MARC-8 ANSEL, ISO5426 or ISO6937 to UCS/Unicode and back;</li>
      <li>Vendor neutral XML support through JAXP and SAX2, a high performance XML interface;</li>
      <li>Support for conversions between MARC and MARC XML;</li>
      <li>Tight integration with the JAXP, DOM and SAX2 interfaces;</li>
      <li>Easy to integrate with other XML interfaces like DOM, XOM, JDOM or DOM4J;</li>
      <li>Command-line utilities for MARC and MARC XML conversions;</li>
      <li>Javadoc documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>MARC4J provides readers and writers for MARC and MARC XML. A <code>org.marc4j.MarcReader</code> implementation parses input data and provides an iterator over a collection of <code>org.marc4j.marc.Record</code> objects. The record object model is also suitable for in-memory editing of MARC records, just as DOM is used for XML editing purposes. Using a <code>org.marc4j.MarcWriter</code> implementation it is possible to create MARC or MARC XML. Once MARC data has been converted to XML you can further process the result with XSLT, for example to convert MARC to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a>.</p>
  <p>Although MARC4J is primarily designed for Java development you can use the command-line utilities <code>org.marc4j.util.MarcXmlDriver</code> and <code>org.marc4j.util.XmlMarcDriver</code> to convert between MARC and MARC XML. It is also possible to pre- or postprocess the result using XSLT, for example to convert directly from MODS to MARC or from MARC to MODS.</p>
  <p>The MARC4J library can also be used for reporting purposes, to import MARC records into databases, or to provide transformations between different MARC formats.</p>

    <h2>About MARC</h2>
    <p>MARC stands for MAchine-Readable Cataloguing. The MARC format is a popular exchange format for bibliographic records. The structure of a MARC record is defined in the ISO 2709:1996 (Format for Information Exchange) standard (or ANSI/NISO Z39.2-1994, available <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-2.pdf">online</a> from NISO). The MARC4J API is not a full implementation of the ISO 2709:1996 standard. The standard is implemented as it is used in the MARC formats.</p>
    <p>The most popular MARC formats are MARC21 and UNIMARC. The MARC21 format is maintained by the <a href="http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>. If you're not familiar with MARC21, you might want to read <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/umb/">Understanding MARC Bibliographic</a>, "a brief description and tutorial" on the standard. For more information on the MARC21 format, visit the <A href="http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/marc">MARC formats</a> home page at the Library of Congress Web site. For more information about UNIMARC visit <a href="http://www.ifla.org/VI/3/ubcim.htm">UBCIM</a> (IFLA Universal Bibliographic Control and International MARC Core Programme).</p>
